        <h1>Course We Offer</h1>
        <p>Pris School has been founded with the intention of reshaping the youth of Cambodia by providing a unique educational journey, which combines the best of both Western and Cambodian education in order to push students to achieve and surpass even the highest international standards of education.At Pris, we equip our students with the necessary skills to prepare them to be independent, lifelong learners, creative individuals, positive contributors and responsible, global thinkers, all while allowing them to retain the values that make them proud and productive members of our Cambodian society.Students at Pris gain an exceptional international learning experience, with an international curriculum that is built upon the US Common Core State Standards (CCSS), adapted to the specific needs of our students.
            </p><p>How are students assessed at Pris School?</p>
<p>
At Pris, students take a series of assessments throughout the academic year that are carefully designed to assess their skills, knowledge and understanding taught throughout each unit. Our assessments are based on ‘real-world’ learning experiences, in order to facilitate a deep connection in our students’ understanding of each of their academic subjects and the practical importance of them in the real world. 

Critical thinking is a core part of our curriculum, which is why all our assessments force students to apply important critical thinking skills that they will need throughout life. Each assessment not only evaluates where students are in terms of their academic progress, but also acts as a new learning experience which will better prepare them for subsequent learning experiences. The goal of assessment is for teachers and students to understand how well they are doing against our academic standards and develop an awareness of what they need to do moving forward for improvement.

                <h2>Computer</h2>
                <p>During this era of technological revolution, information, communication and technology have contributed to significant changes in our world. Meaningful participation in today’s modern world requires fluency in the uses of many types of technology. Given this context, the knowledge and skills in using or creating ICT are essential for all students to be equipped with the knowledge of digital safety, cyber security, malware, computer literacy, reliable content and digital tools to communicate, collaborate, research and present ideas and projects..</p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2>Chinese </h2>
                <p> In addition to being bilingual in English and Khmer, our students are offered the opportunity to discover a third language and culture as an elective– Chinese, which is fundamentally different from both the English and Khmer languages. There are many personal and professional advantages to learning this emerging dominant language in the 21st century.. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2> KHMER</h2>
                <p> Khmer language and literacy are central to developing the cultural and national identities of Cambodia. Khmer language and literacy is crucial for our students in their daily lives and to prosper in all areas of their future endeavors in their beloved homeland. By the end of Grade 12, students will gain strong knowledge in literacy and language skills equivalent to the curriculum approved by the Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h2> ENGLISH</h2>
                <p>The US Common Core state standards for English Language Arts asks students to read stories and literature, as well as more complex texts that provide facts and background knowledge in areas such as science and social studies. Students are challenged and asked questions that encourage them to refer back to what they have read. This approach stresses critical-thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills that are required for success in college, career, and life.Our ELA curriculum focuses on reading assigned set texts, writing, speaking and listening for a wide range of purposes and audiences.  The complexity of texts that students encounter at Pris increases each year, allowing students to develop their reading fluency, comprehension and critical insight into different types of literature.Even though the main focus in ELA is on literature and literary nonfiction texts, the skills that are taught in this subject will transcend the complex literary texts encountered and touch on a variety of other subjects that will allow students to build on their ever-growing knowledge of different concepts and the world around them.. </p>

                <h2> Extre-curricular</h2>
